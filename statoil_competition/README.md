The code in the R file allows the user to take advantage of the data leak in the competition in order to improve the leaderboard score, by applying the script to already submitted predictions. For details you can see the [blog post](http://mlampros.github.io/2018/02/01/Statoil_competition/). 
This script also allowed me the 24th place out of 3343 participants (top 1%).
